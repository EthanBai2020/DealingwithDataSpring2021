    "We've spent some time going into detail about some of the data types and structures available in python. It's now time to talk about how to navigate through some of this data, and use data to make decisions. Traversing over data and making decisions based upon data are a common aspect of every programming language, known as control flow. Python provides a rich control flow, with a lot of conveniences for the power users. Here, we're just going to talk about the basics, to learn more, please [consult the documentation](http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "A common theme throughout this discussion of control structures is the notion of a \"block of code.\" Blocks of code are **demarcated by a specific level of indentation**, typically separated from the surrounding code by some control structure elements, immediately preceeded by a colon, `:`. We'll see examples below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, note that control structures can be nested arbitrarily, depending on the tasks you're trying to accomplish. "

In August, a hacker called “Peace” appeared in online forums, offering to sell 200 million of the company’s usernames and passwords for about $1,900 in total. Peace had previously sold data taken from breaches at Myspace and LinkedIn Corp.\n",
